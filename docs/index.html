            <h2>&#x21B3; About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a recent computer science graduate aiming to start a career in software development. 
                I have a good command of Java, Python, and JavaScript programming languages. I also have good working knowledge 
                of React, HTML, and CSS for front-end programming, and Express, Node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL for the back-end. 
            </p>

                <h3>01. Song Library</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a web application built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that helps users 
                    maintain their own personal library of their favorite songs. The front-end features a token-based user authentication
                    with password hashing for access controls and security. Each user can create, retrieve, update, and delete their songs 
                    to/from the database, along with filtering their search by a specific artist or genre. This is accomplished through 
                    communication with the back-end, which features REST APIs on an Express server connected to the MongoDB database. 
                    The source code can be found

                <h3>02. Hotel Property Management Application</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a desktop application that was built in my Software Design class in university using Java, 
                    Java Swing, and MySQL. Hotel staff would use this application to create and manage customer reservations, 
                    check-in/check-out reservations, and manage room status and conditions. Access controls were built-in to 
                    simplify the UX for users and for security. I helped build much of the front-end of this project. 
                    Please check out the quick demo below to see it in action! The source code can be found

                <h3>03. Simple Stock Dashboard</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a web application that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that ties together my interests in 
                    finance and technology. It uses a <a class="text-links" href="https://www.alphavantage.co/" target="_blank">third-party API</a> 
                    provider to request and receive daily stock prices and company financial data. The user can also perform a 
                    discounted-cash-flow analysis to arrive at an implied share price for a stock based on their assumption inputs.
                    The source code can be found <a class="text-links" href="https://github.com/j-stax/simple-stock-dashboard.git" target="_blank">here.</a>
                    You can also try it out yourself <a class="text-links" href="https://j-stax.github.io/simple-stock-dashboard/" target="_blank">here</a>.
