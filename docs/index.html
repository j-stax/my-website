                <h3>01. Stock Dashboard</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a web application I built using React, Bootstrap, and ChartJS. Users can enter the tickers of their favorite 
                    stocks and be presented with charts representing the comapany's stock price action and financial performance. 
                    The latest news pertaining to the stock/company is also displayed as hyperlinks, so that the user is easily directed to 
                    the news source. Furthermore, the user can perform financial analysis on the company using the discounted-cash-flow (DCF) 
                    model, with the aid of the information presented, as well as their own. The application uses Fetch API to retrieve the 
                    relevant data from a <a class="text-links" href="https://www.alphavantage.co/" target="_blank">third-party API</a> provider.
                    The ticker banner at the top is a <a class="text-links" href="https://github.com/guna81/react-ticker/tree/main" target="_blank">
                    third-party React component</a> modified to fit the needs of this project. The source code for this project can be found 
                    <a class="text-links" href="https://github.com/j-stax/stock-dashboard.git" target="_blank">here.</a> You can also try the app

                <h3>02. Song Library</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a web application built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that helps users 
                    maintain their own personal library of their favorite songs. The front-end features a token-based user authentication
                    with password hashing for access controls and security. Each user can create, retrieve, update, and delete their songs 
                    to/from the database, along with filtering their search by a specific artist or genre. This is accomplished through 
                    communication with the back-end, which features REST APIs on an Express server connected to the MongoDB database. 
                    The source code can be found 
                    <a class="text-links" href="https://github.com/j-stax/music-library-with-auth.git" target="_blank">here.</a>

                <h3>03. Hotel Property Management Application</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a desktop application that was built in my Software Design class in university using Java, 
                    Java Swing, and MySQL in a small group. Hotel staff would use this application to create and manage customer reservations, 
                    check-in/check-out reservations, and manage room status and conditions. Access controls were built-in to 
                    simplify the UX for users and for security. I helped build much of the front-end of this project, all while 
                    learning Java Swing on-the-go. The source code can be found 
                    <a class="text-links" href="https://github.com/Miguel-Graham/EECS3311_Group_Project_Workspace.git" target="_blank">
